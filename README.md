# CS-320_Software_Test_Automation_QA

There are many tools and techniques that can help with writing functional and secure code. Unit tests can be used to test functions by asserting outcomes and comparing them with the results. The testing process can be automated and sped up by placing assertions where necessary. Code coverage tools can also be used to map out which branches have been visited during execution. This can help ensure that a code base is being fully tested if needed. The end user may require a certain kind of maintainability, expandability, or future proofing which could require a program to be able to handle certain string sizes, for example. It is also necessary to implement the right kinds of tests. Critical applications may require more security, for example. This is why it is important to have testing in mind when developing and incorporating user needs into a program.
